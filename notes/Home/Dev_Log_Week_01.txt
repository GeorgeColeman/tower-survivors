====== Dev Log Week 01 ======
Created Monday 11 December 2023

The goal here is to express my intention for each day, and to write the important things that I have done.

By doing this I can (hopefully) make it easier to talk about the game and its development when it comes to creating a dev log.

===== Monday =====
== Intentions ==
When the player levels up, I want the game to pause and force the player to make a choice. It enforces the idea that this is an important moment.

//I predict it will not annoy the player too much because they are choosing something that makes them more powerful.//

We will need a progress bar for player experience.

Need to figure out exactly what the player is selecting when they level up. An idea I have is that they're selecting the 'blueprint' for a tower, which they can then build using gold. They can select that option again to upgrade the tower.

I need to take another pass at the upgrade options and include towers.

//I think the ability to upgrade existing towers is essential to tower defense games.//

== Outcomes ==
Moved experience logic out of individual towers and centralised it in the player. The player now has a single place that is concerned about experience

Gave mobs their own 'experience value' - a simple addition, and seemed as good a time as any to add. More powerful mobs can now grant more experience.

Added a player experience bar to the top of the screen.

The game now pauses and opens a level up screen when the player levels up. The game resumes when the player dismisses the screen.

Upgrade options now include towers. If the player chooses a tower, it's added to the build menu.
